Autonomous Robot Project â€“ Code Repository

This repository contains the complete source code developed for an autonomous robot project conducted as part of a university-level applied electronics course. The robot is built around an Arduino Mega microcontroller and integrates an ESP32 module for wireless communication and machine learning inference via the Grove Vision AI V2 camera. This system utilizes I2C communication in regards to the ESP32-S3 and Arduino Mega 2560. Moreover, the final robot features 3 ultrasonic sensors and 2 servos.

The project explores the intersection of embedded systems, electronics, and applied machine learning & image analysis. Key challenges addressed include real-time sensor integration, communication between heterogeneous components, and the deployment of lightweight AI models under constrained computational conditions.

This repository includes all firmware code for microcontroller operation, communication protocols, sensor interfacing, and control logic. It reflects a systems-oriented approach to hardware-software co-design and demonstrates practical solutions to common issues in robotics, such as latency, component compatibility, and modular code structure.
